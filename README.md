# HousePriceAI-Predictor

A machine learning project to predict house prices using regression techniques with Python, featuring data preprocessing, model evaluation, and visualization.

## Project Overview

This project aims to build regression models to predict house prices based on various features. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

We use the [Ames Housing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data), which contains 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains raw and processed datasets.
- `src/`: Source code modules and main script.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HousePriceAI-Predictor.git
   cd HousePriceAI-Predictor
